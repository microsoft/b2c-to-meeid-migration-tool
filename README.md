> **⚠️ PREVIEW/SAMPLE STATUS**  
> This is a **sample implementation** showcasing the [Just-In-Time password migration public preview](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/external-id/customers/how-to-migrate-passwords-just-in-time). **NOT PRODUCTION-READY**. See [roadmap](#-next-steps-and-future-enhancements) for planned features.

A toolkit for migrating users from Azure AD B2C to Microsoft Entra External ID with minimal downtime and seamless password migration through Just-In-Time (JIT) authentication.

## 🎯 Overview

This migration kit provides a sample solution for identity migration with:

- ✅ **Bulk Export/Import** - Efficient batch processing with retry logic and throttling management
- ✅ **Just-In-Time (JIT) Password Migration** - Seamless password migration on user's first login
- ✅ **Full Observability** - Application Insights integration with metrics and dashboards

## 🏗️ Architecture

**Key Components:**

1. **B2CMigrationKit.Console** - CLI tool for export/import operations
2. **B2CMigrationKit.Function** - Azure Function for JIT password migration
3. **B2CMigrationKit.Core** - Shared business logic and services

> **⚠️ PREVIEW/SAMPLE STATUS**: This toolkit is currently a **sample implementation** to showcase how to implement the [Just-In-Time password migration public preview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/customers/how-to-migrate-passwords-just-in-time?tabs=graph) for export, import and JIT function. Production-ready features including full SFI compliance (Private Endpoints, VNet integration, automated infrastructure deployment) are planned for future releases.

## 🚀 Next Steps and Future Enhancements

This repository currently focuses on exemplifying the implementation of the [Just-In-Time password migration public preview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/external-id/customers/how-to-migrate-passwords-just-in-time?tabs=graph). Future enhancements will include:

- **Automated Infrastructure Deployment**: Alignment with Secure Future Initiative (SFI) standards through automated deployment templates (Bicep/Terraform)
- **Production-Ready Security**: Full integration with Private Endpoints, VNet integration, and Managed Identity
- **Profile Synchronization**: Queue-based bidirectional sync during coexistence phase

These features are planned for upcoming releases to provide a complete enterprise-grade migration solution.

## 📊 Telemetry

This project uses Application Insights to collect telemetry data for monitoring and diagnostics. Telemetry collection is optional and can be controlled via configuration:

- To **enable telemetry**: Set `Telemetry:Enabled` to `true` and provide an Application Insights connection string in `appsettings.json`
- To **disable telemetry**: Set `Telemetry:Enabled` to `false` in your configuration

For local development, telemetry is disabled by default. See the [Developer Guide](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#telemetry-configuration) for detailed configuration options.

**Privacy Note**: When telemetry is enabled, Microsoft may collect information about your use of the software. The data collected helps improve the quality and reliability of the software. For more information about Microsoft's privacy practices, please see the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/privacystatement).
