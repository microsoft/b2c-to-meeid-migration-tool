# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) at [https://msrc.microsoft.com/create-report](https://msrc.microsoft.com/create-report).

If you prefer to submit without logging in, send email to [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com). If possible, encrypt your message with our PGP key; please download it from the [Microsoft Security Response Center PGP Key page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/pgp-key-msrc).

You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message. Additional information can be found at [microsoft.com/msrc](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc).

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

  * Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Policy

Microsoft follows the principle of [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/cvd).

## Security Best Practices

When using this migration toolkit:

1. **Protect Credentials**: Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials to source control
2. **Use Managed Identities**: Prefer Azure Managed Identity over client secrets in production
3. **Secure Key Storage**: Store RSA private keys in Azure Key Vault with HSM protection
4. **Network Security**: Use Private Endpoints and VNet integration for production deployments
5. **Monitor Access**: Enable audit logging and monitoring in Azure
6. **Review Permissions**: Follow principle of least privilege for app registrations
7. **Validate Inputs**: Ensure proper input validation in custom authentication extensions
8. **Keep Updated**: Regularly update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities
